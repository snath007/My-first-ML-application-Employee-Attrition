# My-first-ML-application-Employee-Attrition
The intention of this project is to build a simple API that is in the form of a web application. The application takes various parameters of an employee such as working hours, salary, satisfaction level etc. and the ML algorithm that is present at the back end, predicts whether the employee will stay or leave the company.
